%% General parameters:
%% ppm ranges for analysis: Please put each ppm range in a pair of parentheses in the same line,

%% Uncatalogued (wavelet) component: 
%% Hyper parameters for the global precision priors, lambda is inversely proportional to error variance. 
%% lambda ~ Gamma(a,b/2) on wavelet coefficients:
a - Gamma-distributed with shape a: 0.00001
b - Gamma-distributed with scale b: 0.000000001
%% 
%% Catalogued metabolite component: gamma is the peak width (full width at half max) of metabolite m. 
%% The model for gamma is ln(gamma)= mu + nu_m, where mu is the spectrum-wide average log-peak width  
%% and nu_m is a random effect for each metabolite deviating from mu.  
muMean - Mean of prior on global peak width (mu) in ln(Hz): 0 
muVar - Variance of prior on global peak width (mu) in ln(Hz): 0.1
muVar_prop - Variance of proposal distribution for mu in ln(Hz): 0.002
%% The mean of each prior on nu_m is 0. 
%% Set variance of prior on peak width offset (nu_m) to 0 to turn off the random effect on peak width:  
nuMVar - Variance of prior on peak width offset (nu_m) in ln(Hz): 0.0025
nuMVarProp - Variance of proposal distribution for nu_m in ln(Hz): 0.1
%%
%% Wavelet truncation: tau is a vector of truncation limits, which sets a lower bound on the wavelets
tauMean - mean of the prior on tau: -0.05
tauPrec - inverse of variance of prior on tau: 2
%%
%% Global prior on peak shift (truncated Gaussian)
%% Note: individual priors for each multiplet can be changed in the multi_data(_user).csv file
rdelta - Truncation of the prior on peak shift (ppm): 0.002
csFlag - Specify chemical shift for each multiplet in each spectrum? (chemShiftperSpectra.csv file) (Yes - 1 / No - 0): 0
