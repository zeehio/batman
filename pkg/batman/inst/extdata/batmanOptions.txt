%% Hyper parameters for the global precision priors

a : 0.00001
b : 0.000000001

%% Peak width of metabolite m (gamma), the model for gamma is
%% log(gamma)= mu + nu_m. where mu is the spectrum wide average log-peakwidth  
%% and nu_m is a random effect on metabolite deviated from mu. 
Mean of the prior on mu: 0 
Variance of the prior on mu: 0.1
Proposal variance for the Metropolis-Hastings sampler for mu: 0.002
%% set the following parameter to 0 to turn off the random effect on peak width,
